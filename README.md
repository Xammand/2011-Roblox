   - Roseal Settings: Open [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xammand/2011-Roblox/refs/heads/main/roseal/roseal.json) and right click in the empty space and select 'Save Page As...' and download the file. Then, go to Roseal settings on Roblox, make sure you are on the 'Management' tab, click Browse in the 'Import Data' section, select the file you just downloaded, then press the 'Import Data' button. That's it! (thanks, DemaeMan)
5. IMPORTANT NOTE: As of 1.6.3, the roseal sorts layout settings are no longer supported. Please make sure to reset the sorts layout settings to ensure no bugs. New users do not have to worry about this.
6. Turn Roblox Theme to light mode if not already, otherwise issues will occur. (If you want a dark mode then you can use the OBC theme.)
